# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA

During the MBA academic module, I collaborated with a team of three peers on a data analytics initiative for SVSC Credit Card Company. The project involved working with a substantial dataset, where we utilized Excel tools such as pivot tables, slicers, and dashboards to uncover valuable insights. Our analysis emphasized trend identification, insights into customer spending behaviour, and clear representation of performance data.Our focus was not only on extracting meaningful data but also on presenting it in a clear and professional manner. Throughout the project, we prioritized data accuracy and collaborated closely to validate our findings.We created interactive dashboards that allowed users to filter and explore key business metrics with ease, improving the accessibility of our analysis.The project helped me understand how to turn raw financial data into useful information that can guide business decisions.The project served as a practical application of concepts learned in our UNP course, offering hands-on experience in business data analytics. Through this, we sharpened our skills in data organization, critical thinking, and visual storytelling using Excel.It also highlighted the strategic value of data-informed decision-making within the financial services industry.
